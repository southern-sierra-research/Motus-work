# Motus-work

This project is to track how Motus R book inspired work to look at local Motus station and tag data.  

It is currently focused on project #247 Southern Sierra Research Station Kern River Project (formerly Kern River Valley Tri-colored Blackbird Study).

Recent additions have split things out into 3 files:  project level with QA/QC, single receiver with QA/QC, and multiple receiver plots to see signal strength plots of the same tag on the same timeline, to compare signals across antenna arrays so that we can judge direction of flight.

If you have to download or update either the project or reciever databases, it takes a long time.  Having these tasks seperated out makes it easier to modify just the task you are focussed on.

The receiver and comparative plots are set up so you can knit them to generate a report for sharing.
